00:00:00.000 Hey team, Justin Zeltzer here from zstatistics.com, where today I'm  
00:00:05.430 responding to a challenge that was issued to me. Someone asked me if I could explain statistics  
00:00:11.160 to them in under half an hour. While initially I thought that was a bit of an ambitious ask,  
00:00:17.250 I thought no that's actually a really good challenge, and one that I might do for everybody.  
00:00:23.280 So this is it! An introduction to statistics, with no maths, and done in under half an hour.  
00:00:30.300 Now you can probably see that the the timing of this video is a bit longer than that, but it is  
00:00:36.480 because I bunged on a little extra section at the end- which is a bit of an optional extra,  
00:00:41.220 but I think I get most of it done in under half an hour. But the idea is for you to develop your  
00:00:47.280 intuition around statistics, so it's great for those people who are just enrolling in a  
00:00:52.080 statistics course and are a bit apprehensive, or for others who aren't studying statistics,  
00:00:58.110 but kind of want to know what it's all about. And to keep it light and interesting, I've themed all  
00:01:04.290 of the examples in this video on my latest obsession, which is the NBA. Despite proudly  
00:01:11.310 following Australian sports my brother's getting me hopelessly addicted to American basketball
00:01:19.050 So here we go, the first thing we're going to delve into is what types of data we're going  
00:01:23.700 to encounter when we're dealing with statistics. Now roughly we can divide data into two distinct  
00:01:31.500 classes: categorical data and numerical data. Now they sound somewhat self-explanatory because  
00:01:40.530 numerical means numbers and categorical means categories, so I'll give you some examples of  
00:01:47.880 those in a second, but categorical data can be further split into nominal categorical data and  
00:01:54.480 ordinal categorical data. Nominal meaning there is no order to the various categories  
00:02:02.490 of a particular variable and ordinal means that there is some kind of order to the categories,  
00:02:09.600 and we'll see some examples in a second. Numerical data can be further split into Discrete numerical  
00:02:16.170 data or Continuous numerical data, and again we'll have a look at some examples right now.  
00:02:22.740 So if I was to ask you what team does Steph Curry play for, you can see that clearly the answer to  
00:02:31.530 that question is not going to be numerical, so it's a categorical piece of data. And here in  
00:02:40.260 these brackets I've put what's called the sample space for this particular question. Now Steph  
00:02:47.940 Curry could either play for the Atlanta Hawks, the Boston Celtics etc etc. It turns out he plays for  
00:02:54.840 the Golden State Warriors, but this but all these potential values for what team Steph Curry plays  
00:03:01.380 for when we combine them we call that the sample space and you can see that there's no order to the  
00:03:08.400 teams. It doesn't really matter which order you put them in, so that's why we would say this is  
00:03:12.330 a nominal piece of data. Now the question: what position does Steph play? Well that might provide  
00:03:20.940 us with ordinal categorical data. Now Steph could either play Guard, Forward or Center, or you  
00:03:28.260 could split that up into Point Guard, Shooting Guard etc etc, but there is some loose order to  
00:03:35.160 these positions. The Guards generally play in the back court and then the forwards played closer to  
00:03:39.990 the ring and the center plays underneath it. And also there's a general kind of height difference  
00:03:44.460 between smaller players that play guard to taller players playing forward and the tallest will play  
00:03:51.210 at center so while this is still categorical data, there's some kind of order to it. Now an example  
00:04:02.430 of discrete numerical data might be how many free throws has Steph missed tonight. Clearly he could  
00:04:08.970 miss 0 1 2 3 etc etc. This is numerical data, but importantly he can't miss 1.5 or 2.3 free throws,  
00:04:21.180 right? So there are only discrete possible values that this piece of data can take. And  
00:04:30.390 finally continuous data might be the question: What's Steph's height? Now google lists Steph's  
00:04:38.880 height as 191 centimeters but of course Steph's actual height might be something like 191.3 or .2  
00:04:48.000 .1. 7. You can keep subdividing these centimeters into as many decimal places as you as you like,  
00:04:55.320 so height in this instance is an example of a continuous numerical piece of data. Generally  
00:05:04.230 we kind of make height a discrete piece of data because we only really are interested in whole  
00:05:10.020 centimeters or in the case of the Imperial measure: whole inches. We don't usually care  
00:05:18.900 if someone's you know six foot three and a half or six foot three and two thirds. But in a pure  
00:05:24.630 sense, you could say that height is continuous. Now here's an interesting question: if I asked  
00:05:31.920 you what is Steph's three-point percentage this season, what kind of data do you think that is?  
00:05:38.550 Is it categorical? Is it numerical? And what kind of which of these subcategories would this relate  
00:05:45.030 to maybe you want to pause the video and have a think, but spoiler alert I'm gonna tell you right  
00:05:51.610 now when we have a quick look at what proportions in fact are now. Just appreciate the percentages  
00:05:56.800 and proportions are pretty much the same thing one's just expressed in terms of being out of  
00:06:02.350 a hundred and the other one is just a number between zero and one but it's the same thing  
00:06:08.770 all right now if I was to ask you what is Steph's three-point percentage this season what type of  
00:06:22.390 data do you think this is. Is it categorical or is it numerical and which subcategory do  
00:06:29.920 you think it fits into well feel free to pause the video and have a think about it but spoiler  
00:06:36.820 alert I'm about to ruin it for you when we have a look at a special kind of data called proportions.
00:06:44.320 Now even though I've asked for Steph's three-point percentage, hopefully you could appreciate that a  
00:06:50.980 percentage is in fact just a proportion that's being expressed out of a hundred but we'll note  
00:06:57.790 that each three-point attempt that Steph makes actually provides us with nominal data so it's  
00:07:04.150 either a three-point that's made or a three-point that's missed so what a proportion does is that  
00:07:11.110 it aggregates this information to provide a numerical summary figure so in some senses  
00:07:18.430 a proportion is numerical because obviously it provides us with a number but it's built up off  
00:07:24.220 nominal data now Steph Curry in this season so far in 2018 19 has made 128 three-point shots  
00:07:34.000 and this is his percentage point four seven six six so each of these 128 shots are actually piece  
00:07:41.950 nominal pieces of information this proportion is some kind of summary of that now here's an  
00:07:48.340 interesting question for you is a proportionate and discrete or continuous numerical data and  
00:07:54.010 that's not necessarily so obvious a question and I might leave that to you to answer in the comments  
00:07:58.960 of this video so feel free to start a little discussion on that it's a it's an interesting  
00:08:03.340 one I think anyway that's your data types now distributions if I was to ask how other heights  
00:08:12.790 of NBA players distributed now the smallest player currently playing in the 2018 19 season is Isaiah  
00:08:22.960 Thomas at 5 foot 9 and the largest player is bobbin Marjanovic and seven foot three now all  
00:08:29.830 the other players will fit somewhere between the smallest and largest here we go there's a  
00:08:35.559 pickie of both of those two players anyway what we can present is something called a probability  
00:08:41.500 density function which essentially describes the distribution of all the players in between the  
00:08:47.920 smallest and largest player here so you can think about it in two ways it's either the distribution  
00:08:55.360 of the whole population of basketball players that we have in the NBA or alternatively it's the  
00:09:02.050 probability of selecting someone at random from that population at every given height so quite  
00:09:09.460 clearly as the bulk of the players are going to be somewhere in the middle say six foot six or six  
00:09:14.050 foot five or something if I was to select someone at random I would have the highest probability of  
00:09:20.200 selecting someone around that height as opposed to selecting someone at five foot nine or seven  
00:09:26.140 foot three there's just less players at those Heights right now this curve I'm presenting here  
00:09:31.960 is a very common curve in statistics some people call it a bell curve other people call a normal  
00:09:39.340 distribution but it's a very commonly occurring distribution in statistics and it basically just  
00:09:44.980 means that the bulk of the distribution happens towards the middle and it gets rarer as you go  
00:09:51.340 towards the extremes now I've created a whole video on the normal distribution which I'll  
00:09:57.520 put a little flash hyperlink up now for if you're keen on learning a bit more about it but there's  
00:10:03.340 a symmetry about this distribution with the bulk of the players being around that height now I've  
00:10:10.390 just assumed that this would be the distribution of basketballers heights but what other possible  
00:10:16.930 distributions might there be a distribution like this would indicate that it's the same probability  
00:10:23.650 that if I was to select someone at random from the NBA there'd be the same probability of being six  
00:10:30.520 foot six as they would of being five foot nine or indeed 743 this is called a uniform distribution  
00:10:37.300 which probably doesn't match up with the reality of the NBA a distribution like this we can call  
00:10:45.010 this a bi modal distribution it's got two modes where the mode is just the highest peak of the  
00:10:51.730 graph or something like this which is a skewed distribution let's just say that there's a larger  
00:10:59.140 predominance of players up towards the seven-foot mark and it gets I think it's a lot more scarce  
00:11:04.420 down towards these smaller players and this particular type of skew is actually called left  
00:11:11.050 skew because the tail points in the left direction you can guess what right askew might look like now  
00:11:21.340 before we move on to have a look at sampling distributions I just want to reiterate that  
00:11:25.810 this distribution we've been looking at describes the probability distribution of heights if I was  
00:11:31.480 to select one single player but what if I had a whole sample of players say ten players and  
00:11:39.010 I wanted to know what is the distribution what is the probability distribution of their average  
00:11:43.810 height or for that we'll be looking at sampling distributions so the question is if I select ten  
00:11:51.520 players at random what is the probability distribution of their average height okay  
00:11:57.130 well here's the underlying distribution again now there's five foot nine and there's seven for three  
00:12:03.070 and if I was to let's select someone at random the probability density function would be a bit  
00:12:09.400 like that but if I select ten people and take a look at their average what will that distribution  
00:12:18.040 look like and it turns out that it'll have the same mean but it'll be a lot skinnier now why is  
00:12:25.120 that well think of it this way if I select someone at random it's possible that I select Isiah Thomas  
00:12:30.670 he's five foot nine and while there might only be a few of him in a league that are that small it's  
00:12:37.360 still possible that I select that player at random but if I'm selecting ten players the probability  
00:12:43.570 of them having an average height of five foot nine is very very very small indeed eventually  
00:12:51.400 after selecting Isiah Thomas maybe I'll have to select other players and it's likely that they're  
00:12:56.560 going to be somewhere else in the distribution so that their average gets shifted up right when you  
00:13:02.560 take a sample the larger your sample size is the more unlikely you are to get extreme sample means  
00:13:10.300 so that's why this distribution is going to be a lot skinnier than the distribution on the left  
00:13:18.490 here and this is important in statistics because every study that ever gets conducted starts with  
00:13:24.940 a sample you want to test some kind of effect so you take a sample and then you make an inference  
00:13:30.800 using that sample so it's important for us to get a handle on what happens when we take a sample the  
00:13:37.910 distribution becomes a lot skinnier or in other words the variance of our statistic is reduced and  
00:13:49.760 that indeed takes us to sampling and estimation my question is how good is Steph Curry currently at  
00:13:58.400 three-pointers so in the current season 2018-19 ice he's shot to 128 threes and has nailed 61  
00:14:09.110 of them so that's a point for 766 what I'm gonna try to get across here is that this is actually  
00:14:15.320 a sample statistic he has a sample of size 128 he has 128 three-point attempts and 61 of them have  
00:14:25.160 been successes so here we have that proportion point 4 7 6 6 which is our sample statistic now  
00:14:33.710 when I ask you how good is Steph current Steph Curry at three-pointers appreciate at this point  
00:14:39.350 4 7 6 6 is actually an estimate for this thing we're going to call theta now theta is a Greek  
00:14:47.240 letter and it represents exactly how good Steph Curry is it's something we can never know maybe  
00:14:54.950 he's a 50% shooter but this season he's just a little bit off or maybe he only shoots at 42% and  
00:15:01.130 this season he's doing much better but either way what statistics does is it creates this unknowable  
00:15:09.410 almost godlike god-like value of theta which we can then try to estimate by taking a sample so  
00:15:19.250 given our sample where Steph Curry has currently got point 4 7 6 6 maybe the best estimate for  
00:15:27.110 theta might be point 4 7 6 6 as in if you were trying to guess what you think Steph Curry's  
00:15:33.830 long-run 3-point percentage would be 0.47 6 6 is probably best bet but appreciate that there's some  
00:15:42.470 kind of variance around this estimate some kind of uncertainty if Steph Curry shoots some more  
00:15:49.880 three-pointers this proportion could either go up or down right and all of a sudden that would  
00:15:55.040 be our new best estimate for theta the whole idea behind statistics is trying to get a hold of the  
00:16:02.690 uncertainty you have behind your estimates now I'm not going to enter into calculations of those  
00:16:09.260 of these particular intervals in this video but I've made plenty of videos that delve into this  
00:16:14.990 precise question but what statisticians like to do is create these things called 95% confidence  
00:16:23.540 intervals where we can say look we don't know what theta is but given our sample we have a 95%  
00:16:30.620 confidence that fitas between these two particular values and generally our sample estimate is bang  
00:16:38.210 in the middle of those two limits so that's what you're going to be doing when you study  
00:16:44.570 statistics you're going to be developing means of calculating of quantifying this uncertainty  
00:16:50.720 you have over Steph Curry's long term 3-point percentage or other things maybe more meaningful  
00:16:57.140 now here's an interesting point we all know that Steph Curry is probably the best 3-point shooter  
00:17:03.260 in the league if not in basketball history but at this point in the 2018 2019 season were only about  
00:17:11.990 sort of 12 or 13 games in at this point there's a player called Meyers Leonard who scored 9 out  
00:17:18.109 of 15 three-pointers and has a three-point percentage of 0.6 now who do you think out  
00:17:24.079 of these two players is the better three-point shooter if you were just looking at the sample  
00:17:28.730 statistics here you'd say well Meyers Leonard is right because he's got a 60% or 0.6 proportion  
00:17:34.790 for three-pointers raised Steph Curry's only shooting 0.476 so what is it about Meyers Leonard  
00:17:41.270 that might tweak your intuition that something's not quite right here well let's investigate in  
00:17:47.780 a statistical way this point 6 that we've got for Meyers Leonard is an estimate for he is Theta and  
00:17:53.600 I've got this in green now this is a different theta as the one we saw before which was for  
00:17:58.280 Steph Curry but this is Maya's Leonard's long term three-point percentage and the best estimate for  
00:18:06.110 that again is our sample estimate which is 0.6 ooo but in this case we might find that the confidence  
00:18:15.110 interval we create is a lot larger for Meyers Leonard than it is for Steph Curry why is it a lot  
00:18:22.010 larger for Meyers Leonard well because he's only had 15 three-point attempts in the season so far  
00:18:26.870 so we're going to be less sure about where this value of theta is going to be for Meyers Leonard  
00:18:35.060 but again we can construct here's 95% confidence interval which is going to be a lot wider than  
00:18:41.060 Steph Curry's because we actually had more information for Steph Curry so if you put both  
00:18:47.450 of these two side-by-side the red being Steph Curry and the green being Meyers Leonard it's  
00:18:54.560 true that if we didn't know anything about these two players we'd still have the best estimate for  
00:19:00.650 Meyers Leonard being higher than for Steph Curry but you can see we'd have a much larger confidence  
00:19:06.710 interval for Meyers Leonard in other words would be less confident about where his long-term  
00:19:12.290 3-point percentage is going to be and it could be down here below Steph Curry's and knowing what we  
00:19:19.970 do about the two players it's probably likely to be less than Steph Curry's so again this is  
00:19:28.100 preparing you for what statistics can do which is deal and quantify uncertainty now we've met  
00:19:36.290 theta just a second ago which is this long term three-point percentage but when I described it as  
00:19:43.100 a Greek letter I was referring to it essentially as what we call a parameter now let's have a look  
00:19:49.430 at some common parameters that we're gonna see in the study of statistics you might have heard  
00:19:55.040 of some of these mu is often used for the mean of a numerical variable so for example the main  
00:20:01.640 height of players might be given mu Sigma is the standard deviation of a numerical variable now  
00:20:10.520 I haven't dealt with standard deviation in this video but all standard deviation is is a measure  
00:20:15.860 of the variation a measure of the uncertainty of a particular estimate or the variation of a  
00:20:22.310 particular distribution another parameter PI these are all Greek letters by the way if you haven't  
00:20:28.910 noticed pi is for the proportion of a categorical variable so I could have used PI in that example  
00:20:34.460 I just gave I ended up using theta and as I say down the bottom here theta is generally used for  
00:20:41.000 all parameters in some texts and I like using theta because it sort of is a bit more general  
00:20:47.750 but pi is sometimes used for the proportion Rho is used when you're dealing with the correlation  
00:20:54.560 between two variables and beta is used for the gradient between two variables and that's often  
00:21:00.770 used in regression which is a very important topic in statistics and one for which I've put together  
00:21:08.720 a whole series of videos so you can investigate the videos I've done on regression if you like  
00:21:15.110 now again all these represent parameters all those unknowable fixed values that we try to estimate  
00:21:24.650 now they themselves do not have any uncertainty about them technically they are these godly  
00:21:32.990 figures that we just try to merely estimate as mere statisticians and the way we estimate them is  
00:21:39.260 by taking a sample and those sample statistics are given other symbols for a numerical variable say  
00:21:46.760 height if we're taking the average height off a sample that gets given the simple x-bar a standard  
00:21:54.950 deviation is given the symbol s P is generally used for proportion R for correlation and B for  
00:22:02.420 the gradient so be prepared to see all of these particular lowercase Roman numerals to represent  
00:22:09.920 the sample values that estimate these parameters provided in Greek but I will say be prepared also  
00:22:18.710 for your statistics textbook to break all of those rules because this despite them being conventions  
00:22:25.940 sometimes you'll find they don't stick to them annoyingly all right so with that under our belt  
00:22:33.770 let's go and have a look at a very common topic in statistics called hypothesis testing now I'm  
00:22:42.530 gonna start you off with an example rather than give you some kind of hypothetical definition  
00:22:47.720 here but using the data we've just seen is there enough evidence to suggest that Maya's Leonard  
00:22:54.620 is shooting above 50% so let's review his stats again he's got nine three-pointers made out of  
00:23:02.180 fifth Dean and that's 0.6 so yeah sure his sample is greater than 50% point 5 but is that suggesting  
00:23:12.570 to us that his long-term 3-point performance is going to be above point 5 well that is a  
00:23:20.550 question worthy of a hypothesis test so as we saw in the previous section there's going to be some  
00:23:27.960 variation or variance around this estimate point 600 it's not as if that's going to definitely  
00:23:34.590 be his long-term 3-point proportion so what statisticians like to do is they like to set this  
00:23:43.140 thing called a null hypothesis and it's given the expression H naught and here we're gonna set the  
00:23:51.000 null hypothesis to be that Myers Leonard's long term three-point percentage is less than or equal  
00:23:56.910 to 50% less than or equal to 0.5 now why might we do that well as a statistician we're always very  
00:24:04.980 conservative we assume that the reverse is true and then see if there's enough evidence to really  
00:24:11.070 budge from that assumption it's kind of like when someone's on trial the null hypothesis might be  
00:24:17.730 that they're innocent and you really need a lot of evidence to budge from that null hypothesis  
00:24:23.970 it's not good enough that there's just a little bit of evidence you really need evidence beyond  
00:24:29.550 reasonable doubt right and that's the same with hypothesis tests so this here on the right-hand  
00:24:36.390 side is called the alternate hypothesis and in general whenever we're doing a hypothesis test  
00:24:42.030 in statistics whatever we're seeking evidence for goes in the alternate hypothesis just  
00:24:50.100 for the reason that we're very conservative as statisticians we're always going to have a null  
00:24:56.160 hypothesis that the reverse is in fact true and we're gonna see if our sample is extreme enough  
00:25:02.310 is far enough away from that null hypothesis to suggest that the alternative hypothesis might be  
00:25:10.530 true this is the way you're going to be framing your thinking when you're dealing with statistics  
00:25:15.710 now one thing that different texts different textbooks will do will have different ways  
00:25:20.960 of describing and null hypothesis they both mean the same thing but some will say theta  
00:25:27.770 is less than or equal to 0.5 and others might say something like theta is equal to 0.5 and  
00:25:34.070 it doesn't much matter because the important thing is that theta being greater than 0.5  
00:25:40.610 is in our alternate hypothesis so let's see how this pans out using what we understand now from  
00:25:48.950 a probability distribution so essentially what we're going to do is we're gonna start with this  
00:25:53.720 null hypothesis that theta is equal to 0.5 and if it indeed is equal to 0.5 how many three-pointers  
00:26:01.730 out of 15 would Meyers Leonard sink well here's the probability distribution if he truly is a 50%  
00:26:10.460 3-point shooter and exactly 50% 3-point shooter if he shoots 15 three-pointers on average he's  
00:26:19.280 going to get 7.5 of those in right but of course you can't sink exactly 7.5 so 7 & 8 they'll be  
00:26:27.650 approximately the same height so they'll have the same probability of occurring he's less likely to  
00:26:32.750 get 6 and 9 less likely again to get 5 and 10 etc etc etc so this is the probability distribution  
00:26:39.890 of Meyers Leonard's 15 three-point attempts where the number of successes are on this axis assuming  
00:26:47.840 the null hypothesis is true now for those advanced players this is actually a binomial distribution  
00:26:53.990 if you're keen on learning more I'll put a link up here now what did he get in this sample well  
00:27:01.190 he actually got 9 so what this tells us is that if indeed he has a 50% 3-point percentage it's still  
00:27:09.380 quite likely for him to get nine three-pointers out of 15 it's not beyond the realm of possibility  
00:27:16.940 that he could be a 50% 3-point shooter and just happened to do a little bit better in his first  
00:27:22.130 15 shots than expected now if I was to ask you how much doubt this sample is casting our null  
00:27:29.600 hypothesis in this case you'd say well not very much what if I then told you that say someone else  
00:27:36.890 scored 12 out of 15 three-pointers well let's just say Myers scored 12 out of 15 instead at  
00:27:43.820 that point you're starting to think you know what that's quite unlikely now it's still possible that  
00:27:49.970 he's truly a 50% 3-point shooter and managed to just do better in his first 15 than we expected  
00:27:57.020 but it's starting to now cast some doubt on our null hypothesis and this is what a hypothesis  
00:28:04.310 test does it takes the sample and says how extreme is that sample is it too extreme given our null  
00:28:11.270 hypothesis for us to realistically hold on to that null hypothesis so in reality what's going  
00:28:19.100 to happen is we're going to construct what's called a rejection region we'll find a point  
00:28:24.440 on this x-axis here beyond which we're going to consider it too extreme to realistically hold on  
00:28:31.160 to the null hypothesis being true now this yellow area can effectively be customized to determine  
00:28:39.230 how strict you wanna be with rejecting this null hypothesis but often it's chosen as 5% of the  
00:28:46.880 entire distribution and we call this the level of significance so we might say that the level  
00:28:52.910 of significance here is 5% because if our sample statistic is in this upper 5% we will consider  
00:28:59.480 it too extreme for the null hypothesis and therefore reject the null hypothesis
00:29:07.370 so just to repeat in this case because Maya's Leonard got 9 out of 15 on point 6 he was in this  
00:29:15.890 point here he was at 9 therefore not extreme enough to reject the null hypothesis so even  
00:29:23.420 though in the sample he was shooting above 50% it wasn't extreme enough to allow us to  
00:29:28.970 infer that he's shooting 50% in the long-term we need more evidence as conservative statisticians
00:29:38.340 anyway so I just got a little extra look section here for hypothesis testing just for you to be  
00:29:45.750 aware of two important notes the first thing is that we never ever prove anything in a hypothesis  
00:29:54.510 test so here again is that set up with Meyers Leonard and our conclusion which was to not reject  
00:30:00.870 the null hypothesis as in there's not enough evidence to suggest my as Leonard is shooting  
00:30:05.700 above 50% never say the word prove in your conclusion which is the frustrating thing about  
00:30:13.230 statistics I guess you can never prove anything at all or you can do is infer so we were unable  
00:30:19.650 to infer that Meyers Leonard is shooting above 50% the other thing we never say is the word accept so  
00:30:28.980 notice I've written it and do not reject the null hypothesis so this was our null but in the event  
00:30:35.280 that we do not reject it you should never say the word we then accept the null hypothesis because  
00:30:41.700 don't forget he scored 60% out of the first 15 three-pointers so it's not as if we have  
00:30:48.630 evidence that he's less than a 50% 3-point shooter it's just that we don't have evidence that he's  
00:30:56.700 more than a 50% 3-point shooter that's a really important distinction in fact a whole judicial  
00:31:03.720 system relies on that distinction when you find someone not guilty that doesn't necessarily mean  
00:31:11.160 that they're innocent right it just means that there's not been enough evidence to convince you  
00:31:15.870 of their guilt and because of the presumption of innocence they walk free okay so let's have  
00:31:26.490 a look at p-values now they're the much-maligned p-values in statistics now to introduce them i've  
00:31:34.890 said considering a null hypothesis so whatever null hypothesis were testing hypothesis tests  
00:31:42.930 assess if our sample is extreme enough to reject the null hypothesis that's exactly what we did in  
00:31:49.470 the last section what the p-value does is that then measures how extreme the sample is so the  
00:31:58.110 hypothesis tests sort of set up the goal posts and we assess whether we've scored the goal or not but  
00:32:03.930 the p-value measures out exactly how far we kicked the ball to continue with a fairly loose analogy  
00:32:10.770 there so here's the example again we're using the same setup as before with Meyers Leonard's 50%  
00:32:18.630 three-point percentage so our test statistic was 9 so he got 9 out of 15 three-pointers right and  
00:32:26.100 this is the distribution under the null hypothesis so how extreme was his test statistic that we got  
00:32:33.120 well we found out it wasn't extreme enough right so the hypothesis test said reject the null  
00:32:39.450 hypothesis if the test statistic is in the top 5% of the distribution and indeed we found that  
00:32:46.710 he was not in the top 5% of the distribution what the p-value does is it takes our test statistic  
00:32:53.490 and actually calculates that region so it says our test statistic is in the top 30 point 4 percent of  
00:33:00.240 the distribution 0.304 so it's actually measuring how much of the distribution is at or above our  
00:33:08.610 test statistic so in other words it's measuring how extreme our sample is so if our p-value is  
00:33:17.610 very small the more extreme our sample must have been and therefore the more likely we are to  
00:33:23.760 reject the null hypothesis and if the p-value is large we're less likely to reject the null  
00:33:30.570 hypothesis so if it's closer to one it's this one is this was 0.3 so we had quite a large pink area  
00:33:37.590 here we become less likely to reject the null hypothesis and that's exactly what happened in  
00:33:42.750 our case we did not reject our null hypothesis now the final point I might make and it's something  
00:33:50.250 that you probably have figured out already maybe but if this p-value drops below 0.05 it implies  
00:33:57.810 that our test statistic must be in the rejection region let me repeat that if the p-value is less  
00:34:05.100 point O five it means that our test statistic wherever we are must be in the rejection region  
00:34:11.400 so that rejection region was constructed that yellow bit let's go back that yellow bit was  
00:34:17.190 constructed so there's five percent that's been highlighted five percent of the whole distribution  
00:34:21.690 that's been highlighted so if our p-value is less than five percent or less than 0.05 if  
00:34:28.710 the pink bit was less than 0.05 we know that we must be somewhere in that rejection region our  
00:34:35.610 test statistic must be in the rejection region so what that implies is if the p-value is less than  
00:34:44.730 the level of significance for your hypothesis test you're going to reject the null hypothesis  
00:34:50.969 so it's a really quick way of assessing whether we're going to be rejecting our null hypothesis  
00:34:57.270 right so all up whenever you conduct a hypothesis test let's sort of recap whatever you're seeking  
00:35:04.530 evidence for goes in your alternate hypothesis and then if you conduct the test and your p-value is  
00:35:11.550 very very small that provides evidence for that alternate hypothesis it provides evidence enough  
00:35:20.520 for us to reject the null hypothesis all right so that's pretty much it for the theoretical  
00:35:27.180 component of this video stop the clock did I get under 30 minutes I don't think so I think  
00:35:33.360 it was a few minutes over but I'm not even going to quiet stop the video here because I figured I  
00:35:39.000 might give you an extra little section to do with p-values because they've been in the news over the  
00:35:45.090 last few years I would say and not necessarily in a good way people have been throwing a lot  
00:35:51.180 of shade at scientific research over the last little while and it's somewhat justified due to  
00:35:56.610 this thing called P hacking so if you've had enough with the theoretical component of the  
00:36:01.350 stats today well I'll tell you that's it we're done but let's have a look at P hacking to see  
00:36:06.840 how a misuse of p-values can invalidate scientific research so let's talk about what P hackings all  
00:36:16.130 about and I might start with that same boring old probability density function that we saw before  
00:36:21.830 now as we've seen in hypothesis testing we start with the null hypothesis that there's no effect  
00:36:29.270 and then we take a sample and we want to see a sample that's extreme enough for us to reject that  
00:36:36.110 null hypothesis so we'll construct this rejection region which is this yellow shaded region up here  
00:36:42.620 my choice of colors might not have been the best but hopefully you can see that's shaded yellow  
00:36:47.780 and so if our sample lies up in this region here we're able to reject the null hypothesis and in  
00:36:55.610 doing so we would say that there's a significant effect and all of a sudden that's great we'll be  
00:37:00.440 able to publish our paper to show that X affects Y and we'll get all the plaudits from the research  
00:37:07.310 community but here's the thing remember how I said that statistics doesn't prove anything well this  
00:37:15.200 is exactly the case if we have a sample which is in our rejection region in other words a sample  
00:37:21.710 which is extreme enough for us to reject the null hypothesis it doesn't mean the null hypothesis is  
00:37:28.460 false it's still possible that we just happen to get a freak sample right the whole purpose of a  
00:37:36.530 p-value is to say well how likely is it for us to get this sample statistic if the null hypothesis  
00:37:44.420 is true and if the p-value is low enough we go oh that's starting to become too low but at the same  
00:37:51.350 time as long as that p-values nonzero there is an outside chance but you just happen to get a freak  
00:37:59.150 sample where there was in fact no effect to put it in the basketball terms just say my as Leonard was  
00:38:07.940 a 50% 3-point shooter it's still possible for him to score 14 or 15 out of 15 three-pointers  
00:38:15.620 right very unlikely if his true 3-point percentage was 50% but it's possible so how does this relate  
00:38:26.560 to good and bad research well in good research what you do is you theorize some kind of effect  
00:38:34.540 and maybe that might be that red wine causes cancer let's just say that as an example right  
00:38:39.880 we then collect our data and we test only that effect red wine causing cancer and if we find  
00:38:50.620 the p-value of this test less than 0.05 we can conclude some strong evidence for the effect  
00:38:56.710 of red wine on cancer and that's all well and good and that's good research that process of  
00:39:02.830 theorizing some effect then collecting your data and testing that exact effect is how one conducts  
00:39:10.570 good research now bad research gets conducted like this and unfortunately I'm gonna suggest  
00:39:18.790 this gets done all the time if you collect your data first with just the general idea of let's  
00:39:25.960 see what causes cancer so let's collect a whole bunch of data from people that have cancer a lot  
00:39:31.450 of lifestyle kinds of pieces of data as well whether they smoke whether they drink wine all  
00:39:37.060 this kind of stuff we're gonna test all these different effects we're gonna test red wine  
00:39:40.960 we're gonna test smoking we're gonna test exercise we're gonna test exposure two main roads all this  
00:39:48.730 kind of stuff and then we're gonna look through all those effects and find the ones where P is  
00:39:52.930 less than 0.05 but let's just say it happened to be four where we're testing red wine on cancer  
00:40:00.970 and then we're gonna publish our results and say yep red wine causes cancer because the p-value  
00:40:06.100 is less than 0.5 this is called pee hacking and is potentially rife in research and it's quite  
00:40:14.950 problematic now it's not necessarily obvious why this is so much worse than our good research over  
00:40:21.130 here on the left but as I said before when we conclude strong evidence for some effect  
00:40:27.940 we're essentially saying there's a very very low probability that this came about by chance now  
00:40:35.950 what happens when you test 10 different things if you test 10 different things it becomes more  
00:40:42.610 likely that one of them by chance will be quite extreme in their sampling well let's push it even  
00:40:49.150 further if you test 20 different things we're actually expecting 1 out of those 20 things to  
00:40:56.890 have a p-value less than 0.05 that's actually what the p-value means if there's a 5% chance  
00:41:04.780 that the effect we've seen was just due to the randomness of the sampling process than if we test  
00:41:10.630 20 things 5% of 20 is 1 one of those 20 things is likely to show that strength of effect so that's  
00:41:20.200 where he hacking comes into it we test all these different things and we just find the one that  
00:41:25.270 happens to look significant and we can then sort of pretend that that was the thing that we were  
00:41:31.120 looking for the whole time and it's actually a big big problem anyway that's hopefully brought  
00:41:37.630 brought it into practice some of the stuff that you can learn in statistics and of course I've  
00:41:42.640 dealt with things in a very superficial way but that was the whole point of this video but look if  
00:41:48.790 you like this I've got more in-depth discussions one where I go into the actual formula and the  
00:41:54.670 mathematics of it all you can check it all out on Zed statistics com but hey if you dig it you  
00:42:00.130 can like and subscribe and do all those things that you're meant to do but yeah hope you enjoyed
